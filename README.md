This is an ISDB-T receiver that uses Linux DVB v5 API and channel table for ITU Region 2 (Americas).
It should work for all the countries in Latin America that uses the ISDB-T International (also known as ISDB-Tb, SATVD and SBTVD) stardard.

I am grateful to the authors of this program.
I adjusted it to suit the terrestrial digital broadcasting in Japan.
And changed to be able to specify the adapter number.
